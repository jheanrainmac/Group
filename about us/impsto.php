							<h1>What the problem was??</h1>
							<h2>Books are expensive!!</h2>
							<h4>Every course at The UWI MONA
							has a list of prescribed text books that
							students are expected to source...
							If only they knew that the cost of academic books
							have increased by 35% in the last 5 years!!!!!<br/></h4>
							<h2 style="font-align: center">The Notice Boards don't help</h2>
							<h4>When looking for information on books, housing,
							parties, hall activities, anything that has to do with 
							campus life really....where do students head???</h4>
							<h3>The Notice Board???<h3>
							<h4>Problem is, the notice boards around campus
							are always filled to capacity with fliers advertising
							everything from the latest cell phone, to the latest
							campus party! - not very conducive to book buying</h4>

							<h1>What we did about it</h1><br/>
							<h2>Our idea</h2>
							<h4>If books are so expensive, why not make
							used books more availabe, there are tons of people
							on campus with books they don't use anymore, and
							they would be significantly lower in cost!<br/></h4>
							<h4>The same goes for off-campus housing - though
							it may not be as cheap :D</h4>
							<h2>Where does everyone go when they need information?</h2>
							<h4>No, not Google!, but close enough.... The INTERNET ofcourse!
							Hence we decided to go with a Website that would provide the same
							online shopping experience found elsewhere, right here on the 
							UWI campus.</h4>
							<h3>NotizBlock was Born!<h3>
							<h4>notizblock.com is the most convinient place for the students of 
							UWI Mona to get rid of their old books and buy some..(maybe not so) 
							new ones. Find the books you need, and places near school to 
							stay, all you have to do is Register NOW!!</h4>
