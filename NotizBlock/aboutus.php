							With the objective of: expanding an under utilized market with 
							the use of internet technology - NotizBlock was born.
							Spearheaded by students of the UWI MONA Computer Science Department,
							NotizBlock aims to accomodate the growth of the 'used book' market
							by making it easy for staff and students alike to buy and sell the 
							books they need.

							housing/rooms off campus. Yet again, NotizBlock is aiding a very 
							popular yet under utilized part of campus life.
